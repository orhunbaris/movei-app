# Movie Search App

This is a web application built with **React** and **TypeScript** that allows users to search for **movies**, **TV series**, and **TV episodes**. The app integrates with the [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/) to fetch movie and TV data. Users can search for these by title, and the app provides a detailed view for each result. 

The app supports filters such as movie type (movie, series, episode), and release year. The search is based on a keyword in the title, so users can search for specific words within movie, series, or episode titles.

## Features

- **Search for Movies, TV Series, or Episodes**: Users can search for movies, TV series, or individual TV episodes by title. The search matches the keyword against the movie, series, or episode title.
- **Filters**: The app allows filtering by:
  - **Movie Type**: Movie, Series, or Episode
  - **Release Year**: Filter movies and TV shows by year.
- **Movie/TV Details**: Clicking on a result takes the user to a detailed page displaying additional information, including title, genre, actors, director, IMDb rating, and more.
- **Error Handling**: Custom error messages are displayed when no results are found or when there is an issue fetching data.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, SCSS, Redux for state management
- **API**: OMDb API for fetching movie and TV data
- **Styling**: SCSS for component-level styling
- **Routing**: React Router for navigation between the homepage and the detailed view page
